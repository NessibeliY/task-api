# task-api

A simple HTTP service for handling long-running asynchronous I/O-bound tasks (e.g. 3â€“5 minutes) entirely in memory, without any external databases, queues, or services.

##  Features

- Create tasks
- Fetch task by ID
- Fetch all tasks
- Delete task
- Track task status, creation time, and processing duration

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

- Go 1.22 or higher

### Run the Server

```bash
go run .
```

By default, the server listens on port 8080.

}'
```

2. Get Task by ID

3. Get All Tasks
```bash

curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks/1'
```

 Notes for Developers
	â€¢	All data is stored in memory â€” restarting the service clears all tasks.
	â€¢	Tasks are processed asynchronously using goroutines.
	â€¢	Task processing duration is simulated and can be configured for real workloads later.
	â€¢	The codebase is clean and extensible: ideal for adding more task types, metrics, persistence, etc.
